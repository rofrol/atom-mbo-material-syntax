# mbo-material-syntax theme

Theme based on https://atom.io/themes/mbo and colors used in http://elm-lang.org/examples/.

Main motivation was to make mbo work with [material ui theme](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui), so that ui uses `background-color` from syntax theme. And also make it more flat by removing different color for gutter.

Differencies from http://elm-lang.org/examples/
- chars `=` and `->` aren't orange
- background and colors are darker `` `andThen` `` and similar are orange
- `_` isn't orange
